# JPA

John Peel Archive
This repo is for the John Peel Record Archive at www.johnpeelarchive.com

## How to get going with JPA
### Society shared repo
Grab the shared society repo (if you don't already have it):
```
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/webuildsociety/society.git
```

Then create a symlink from society's include to your project's include:
```
ln -s ~/git/society/include/society ~/git/JPA/include
```

##Â Reduced size
- /archiver currently has no /i directory for record images - you will need a backup if you restart this project
