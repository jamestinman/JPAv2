1
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm just going to indulge myself with one more Maytals

2
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Which again, is something I've never heard of

3
00:00:29.500  --> 00:00:35.000
[music plays]

4
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.500
I'm Joe Boyd

5
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I was, and to a certain degree still am, a record producer, for many years...

6
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
...but more of a writer now.

7
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm in the middle of working on a book about the dubious subject called World Music.

8
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I live in London, I am a record collector - have been since I was 11.

9
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And I still have some of the vinyl that I bought in my early teens

10
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
John Peel's record collection has always been a sort of golden mountain in the distance... 

11
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
...you know that kind of legendary place. You know he talked about it...

12
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
...people had written about it... it's a legendary spot so I'm very pleased...

13
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.000
...and honoured to be invited to come have a look around

14
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This is the room where the shows were put together

15
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.000
Liverpool football

16
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.500
There was definitely something happening in this, if we go into the Seventies, the Sixties

17
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I think any art form, it's most interesting when it's new. 

18
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Hell, rock and roll wasn't new in the Sixties, what was new, was middle class kids coming into it...

19
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.000
...and with The Beatles and Dylan and Jagger and Richards... 

20
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.000
...you had people who were outside the music studying it, going into it with a different perspective

21
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So all that stuff is so fresh, and then the Seventies for me... 

22
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.000
...people start to go over the same ground again, or change it.

23
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You know punk was a great sociological thing...

24
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
...but it wasn't for me as interesting as some of the earlier manifestations of this.

25
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.500
I'm a great believer in randomness

26
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.000
I just like the idea of opening something at random

27
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.500
The Fall, I cross a lot of Fall records, right that one would expect

28
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.500
But there we go, there's Art Farmer and Donald Bird...

29
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.000
...two great trumpet players 

30
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Art Farmer, Gary Farr and the T-Bones.

31
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:57.000
Gary Farr and the T-bones were playing at the Marquee Club when I was first in Soho in 1965. 

32
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Not that great but...

33
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.500
...Joe Farrell, the Joe Farrell Quartet, I mean this is triggering so many memories. 

34
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.500
Well, this is a bit

35
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.500
I mean even for me, with my 6000 LP's at home, this is quite overwhelming.

35.5
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:38.000
[music plays]

36
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I mean, this is a good record, but it's a great record cover...

37
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.000
...a lesson in how to make a great record cover.

38
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.000
Blue Thumb Records, a kind of a maverick record company. 

39
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.500
I mean just so outrageous...

40
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
...Ike and Tina Turner, in whiteface, eating watermelon. 

41
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.500
Mick Farren, my god, you see random

42
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Mick Farren, the worst singer ever to make a record, probably.

43
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I think we're in the early days of John's collecting here

44
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.500
The Soft Machine, who used to play at UFO as well as Pink Floyd.

45
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The thing I loved about The Soft Machine was Robert Wyatt's singing...

46
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.000
...even when he was a drummer, he used to sing from the drumkit.

47
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.000
Really good drummer, vocal mike coming over his head

48
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Great, I mean not that many people can sing well from a drumkit, and he's one of them.

49
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.500
This is so interesting cause it's that phenomenon that we know, we hear about, legendarily...

50
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
...of sound systems scratching out titles so that nobody else will know what the song is.

51
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And it was started back in the fifties, when the Jamaican cane workers were going to Florida

52
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:33.000
and realised that DJ's loved getting American records, and once they got one they didn't...

53
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.000
...want anyone to know what it was so they couldn't send for someone to get it in Florida either...

54
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.500
...so they'd scratch out the titles. 

55
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
'Thatcher on Acid', good name, don't know them.

56
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.000
Let's see, what have I got in the box.

57
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
This is a record that I don't have anymore, that I used to have...

58
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000
...'The Rural Blues', compiled and annotated by Sam Charters, a great pioneer of blues studies. 

59
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Chess' Golden Decade, this just looks like an amazing record, it's Chess Records' Golden Decade.

60
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It's got Bobby Charles, who was a great character out of Louisiana, who wrote 'See You Later Alligator'...

61
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.000
...and Bill Haley had a big hit with it.

62
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.800
'Sincerely' by The Moonglows, which is one of the great Doo-Wop records of all time.

63
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Howlin' Wolf, 'Smokestack Lightning', Clarence 'Frogman' Henry, 'Ain't got no Home'

64
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.500
Jimmy Mccracklin, 'The Walk', Dale Hawkins, 'Susie Q' 

65
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
My god, The Monotones - 'Book of Love', this is an extraordinary collection. 

66
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
The Purple Gang, a jug band from Macclesfield Ladies and Gentlemen, who I did a single with...

67
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.000
...this is such a great cover, very Lancashire. 

68
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
One of the worst covers ever to grace a record I produced, my friend Geoff Muldaur...

69
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.000
...'Is Having a Wonderful Time', this is taken at Speakers' Corner in London... 

70
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:23.000
...when he came over to work on the record in London, with some devout Christians praying.

71
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
They weren't posed, they were actually praying.

72
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Boz Scaggs, the young Boz Scaggs having just left Steve Miller, very 1970's I'd say, this cover...

73
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:42.500
...little half moon, the kind of slightly Macclesfield parish-esque illustration. 

74
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
What else have we got here? I'm doing a critique of the covers as well.

75
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.500
This is a good cover, Thomas Mapfumo and the Blacks Unlimited, probably out in the bush with the rebels.

75.5
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:14.000
[music plays]

76
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000
This music is such a great example of an African culture taking it's own traditions...

77
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.000
...and adapting it to electric guitars and modern modernity in a way.

78
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:33.500
Because that beat, that whole pattern of the rhythm guitars is Mbira, it's a thumb piano

79
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and that's the basics in music of that part of Africa, is that singing while accompanying yourself on thumb piano. 

80
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And Mapfumo was just the master of all of that, he would record singles that would be coded messages

81
00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000
you know, while the troops were still fighting in the bush, and eventually he was you know

82
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:08.000
sort of the Poet Laureate of the revolution in Zimbabwe. 

83
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.000
Moby Grape, pretty good classic... I don't know what exactly.

84
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:22.000
Sixties, haircuts, everything. The extended middle finger on the washboard.

85
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Them, featuring Van Morrison, early Van Morrison, with that classic 'Here Comes the Night'. 

86
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.500
'The Rooster Crowed in England', Sam 'Lightning' Hopkins, not quite sure what...

87
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.500
...the rooster has to do with 'Lightning' Hopkins.

88
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.000
Great original cover.

89
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.500
Well, this is a record that kind of changed the world and it wasn't even a record. 

90
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
It was a demo, it was a publishers demo, Bob Dylan.

91
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:19.000
The beginning of this period, 1965, was when Dylan had made a record, Highway 61 Revisited

92
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and he put out a single, six minute long single: 'Like a Rolling Stone'. 

93
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
It had, y'know that organ riff that Al Cooper did, and drums and bass 

94
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.000
it was on the radio, it was all over the place 

95
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.000
and I was the production manager for the Newport Folk Festival...

96
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.000
...in the summer of 1965, and all anyone could talk about was

97
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.500
What's Dylan gonna do?

98
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.500
He wouldn't dare, he wouldn't bring his band, he wouldn't play with a band...

99
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.500
...at the Folk Festival, would he?

100
00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000
He'd never played live with a band, and yes he did, and it was amazing.

101
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.000
And Alan Lomax and Pete Seeger came over to me and said, you've got to turn the sound down...

102
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:14.000
...it's way too loud, and I went up to the sound controls in the middle of the audience.

103
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Albert Grossman was there, Dylan's manager, and Paul Rothchild, who was mixing the sound,

104
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.000
who I'd brought up to mix the sound. 

105
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:33.500
And Peter Yarrow, from Peter, Paul and Mary, and Peter was like the token young person on...

106
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
...the board of the Newport Folk foundation.

107
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:42.000
And I came over and I gave the message from Lomax and Seeger, and Peter said 

108
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:53.000
'Tell Alan that the Board of the festival is represented at the sound controls, and the representative out here...

109
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.500
thinks the sound is just fine'.

110
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And I turned to go and he said, 'Oh Joe, tell him'...

111
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I mean that was that atmosphere, it was so tense, it was so hostile between the generations,

112
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.000
and I think it really did change everything.

113
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.500
The Folk Festival was never the same, Folk Music was never the same, Jazz was never the same

114
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
because all those Jazz clubs started becoming rock clubs

115
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and the kind of non-conformist kids that used to wear black turtlenecks, and smoke coburns and listen to Miles Davis

116
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.000
were suddenly at Grateful Dead shows taking acid.

117
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.500
And then Dylan had the motorcycle accident, and went off and disappeared,

118
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:39.000
and all of a sudden there was these whispers went around Soho in London, that there was a demo...

119
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:45.000
...at Feldman's Music which was on Charring Cross Road, just up the Road from Dobell's record store.

120
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.500
And you could go in there, they wouldn't give you a copy, you could go in there and listen to the demo.

121
00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And Julie Driscoll and Brian Auger and The Trinity, covered 'This Wheel's on Fire'. 

122
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.500
Manfred Mann covered 'Quinn the Eskimo' from this demo. 

123
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:15.500
Fairport Convention covered 'Million Dollar Bash', on 'Unhalfbricking'.

124
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I remember that day, we all went in, and crowded into this tiny listening booth...

125
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.500
...and the Professional Manager from Feldman's came out and took the record and put it on the turntable

126
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and dropped the needle, and we were all just like... wow. 

127
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:38.000
You know it was just an incredible experience to listen to it, and to see this thing.

128
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:43.000
I mean it's been reissued and bootlegged and you can see it at the 'Great White Wonder' and all sorts of places,

129
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.000
but I have a feeling that this might be the proper acetate

130
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.500
Yes, it's definitely a test pressing. 

130.5
00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:11.000
[music plays]

131
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
I was working with the Fairport, we'd already done two records

132
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and we were in the middle of making this one, 'Unhalfbricking'. 

133
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And I got a call from Simon Nicol, and he said 'We've got a couple of new numbers we'd like you to hear...

134
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.000
...can you come down to one of our gigs?'

135
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.000
So I drove down to Bristol, went to this ballroom of some kind, 

136
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.000
and in the middle of the set

137
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
they said that they'd learnt this song from Sandy Denny, who was their singer now. 

138
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And she used to play British folk songs in the van, as they were driving around,

139
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.500
or in the dressing room, while they were waiting around, 

140
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and they'd liked this song and they did an arrangement of it. 

141
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
It was 'A Sailors Life', and I went backstage after and I said 

142
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.000
'Yeah we've gotta record this, it's fantastic'.

143
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:12.000
And then they said to me 'We were thinking, what if we got somebody, a traditional musician...

144
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.000
...like Dave Swarbrick to play on it.

145
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.000
And then I said 'If you want Dave Swarbrick, I'll call up Swarbrick'.

146
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.000
And they said 'D'you know Swarbrick?'

147
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:25.000
And they'd suddenly discovered this world of English Folk music that they knew nothing about.

148
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.500
They were all oriented towards American Folk Rock 

149
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
and they were the classic English kids who didn't like Folk music.

150
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
They didn't dislike it, they were more open minded than most, but they had never taken it seriously.

151
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:45.000
And all of a sudden just this one tune, they thought, let's do this, we like this tune.

152
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:50.000
And so I called Swarbrick and he came in and he played violin,

153
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.000
and this was like a first take, maybe one run through, and then we did this take.

154
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Richard and Swarbrick kept swapping solos, and it changed the game in English Folk music.

155
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:10.000
Which actually brings us directly to the next one because Nick Drake.

156
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
His story is very connected to Fairport and to that whole period of Fairport

157
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:22.000
which was after the six month period where Martin has died, the group almost broke up 

158
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.000
then they went out to the farm in the country, and woodshedded, and invented themselves all over again. 

159
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
And we put out 'Liege and Lief' and three weeks later we had this date at the Festival Hall.

160
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.000
And the impact of the record was such and everybody knew what had happened

161
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
that Melody Maker was all over the story, people had been out to interview them

162
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
talked about how exciting what they were doing was.

163
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:58.000
And so, the place was sold out, and it was very respectful, because of the grave circumstances.

164
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And so I had John and Beverley Martyn open the show,

165
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.000
Cause Fairport didn't have, probably if they'd had a big repertoire by that time,

166
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.300
we would have had them do the whole concert.

167
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:18.000
But they didn't, they only had an hour's worth of tunes. That's all they knew. 

168
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.500
They had completely invented a new repertoire. 

169
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
So we had to have them do the second half of the concert. 

170
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
The first half, half an hour from John and Beverley, half an hour from Nick. 

171
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And we had John and Beverley first because I knew that sending Nick out to open a show was gonna be fatal.

172
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.000
So at least John could tell some jokes and Beverley could be funny and friendly

173
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:48.000
and they would warm everybody up, and then Nick would have his slot before the interval.

174
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:54.000
And everybody was incredibly respectful, and it was fantastic, it was so thrilling.

175
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.000
You could hear a pin drop, and Nick didn't say a word, but he was flawless. Perfect. 

176
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:10.000
And people were completely mesmerised, and gave him a huge ovation and he had to do an encore. 

177
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
This was right after this record came out, and we were all just

178
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
'It can happen, it can happen'.

179
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000
We were so happy, everybody in the office loved Nick. But we got overconfident because of that.

180
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
We thought, okay now we can send him out. 

181
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.000
And we sent him out on this tour and it was just a disaster.

182
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
The circumstances were never the same. 

183
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.000
And so he called up after four days and said 'I can't do this anymore'.

184
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.000
And cancelled the rest of the tour. Never played live again. 

184.5 
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:52.000
[music plays]

185
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Not too sure about this cover, but hey, it's got the beautiful Syd in the middle. 

186
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.000
Which is all you really need.

187
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
So it kind of works in a way.

188
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.000
And this is of course the record that, I feel tragically, I didn't get to produce.

189
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
After we did the deal with EMI, EMI said 'No no no, we've gotta have our in house producer'. 

190
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And this is the record that I produced thanks to John Peel.

191
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.500
Because he introduced me to them and told them about me and me about them. 

192
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Charlie Mingus, I just chose this. This is a reissue, so this isn't the original cover.

193
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.000
The original cover is more interesting. 

194
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
But still, anything that has a picture of Charlie Mingus can't be all bad. 

195
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
This is a very very good cover I think, 'Brian Jones presents The Pipes of Pan at Jajouka'.

196
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.000
Brian's venture into Moroccan Trance music. 

197
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.000
And then we have some singles.

198
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
'The Intro and The Outro' by Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band.

199
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.000
'Say You Don't Mind' by Denny Laine. Great record. 

200
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
'My White Bicycle' by Tomorrow. 

201
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
What's this? My White Bicycle, the original mono version. 

202
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Single, that's good, okay let's have that.

203
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Now a little nerdy collectors point, but also relevant to this history.

204
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.000
At UFO in the spring of '67, after Pink Floyd had broken out, and Soft Machine had kind of broken out

205
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
what we had was a small place, we couldn't pay a lot of money.

206
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.000
And so they were making bigger money elsewhere, I was always on the lookout for new groups.

207
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.000
And somebody recommended this group 'Tomorrow', and I went and heard them at Blazes'

208
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
I bought them down to UFO and people just adored them. 

209
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.500
It was such an interesting time because, there were these pioneering groups

210
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
like Pink Floyd and Soft Machine, who were already into kind of taking music in another direction.

211
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.000
But then there were these bands like Pretty Things, Tomorrow, The Nice

212
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:32.000
all these bands that had been blues bands, or straight pop bands of various kinds.

213
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Then somewhere in the winter or spring of '67, they all took acid.

214
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
And the music just completely changed and became this much weirder kind of music and we used to book them at UFO.

215
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000
And Tomorrow was one of them, and they had this number called 'My White Bicycle', which was a great song...

216
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.000
...we used to play it all the time, the record and the group came down, people loved it when they played it.

217
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
And it just became the symbol of the second era of UFO.

218
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:10.000
UFO only lasted nine months in all but it did have actual periods, different eras within that nine months.

219
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.500
Arnold Layne. 

220
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
The atmosphere of when Pink Floyd played live before they went on to have their hit singles...

221
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:24.000
...was these long extended improvisations that Syd Barrett used to do.

222
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:31.500
And even when you started with a tune, like 'Arnold Layne', they would then go into these long improvisations...

223
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
...and then return to the song.

224
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.000
And the inspiration for that: this record. 

225
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:45.000
But there is here, an astonishment for me because I never would have imagined that John would have this.

226
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
This is one of the few records that I feel I ought to have but I don't.

227
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.000
So, search me as I leave.

228
00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:01.000
This is a very very obscure record, but kind of legendary. AMMMusic. 

229
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Cornelius Cardew, Keith Rowe. This was the most out of the Avant-Garde, Abstract music scene...

230
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:19.000
...in the Sixties in London. Cornelius Cardew the famous composer, piano player. 

231
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
And John Hopkins, my partner at UFO knew all these guys, he was into this stuff.

232
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.500
And he convinced me, I don't know why I agreed, when I was running the Elektra Records office in London

233
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.000
to make a record with these guys, and it was all done in one evening, at Sound Techniques...

234
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.000
...It was one of the first things I ever did at Sound Techniques, which was where I ended up recording...

235
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.000
...Nick Drake and Pink Floyd and everything. 

236
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
But the other guy involved was Peter Jenner, who was also involved with the London Free School.

237
00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And he was a big fan of these guys, and he took Syd Barrett when he came down from Cambridge...

238
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:06.500
...to see these guys, and Syd you know was writing all these nice songs... 

239
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
...these cute, funny, weird songs like 'Arnold Layne' and 'Candy in a Current Bun' and all this kind of stuff. 

240
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.500
But when he heard these guys, this is where he got the idea to start doing all these abstract...

241
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
...noises on the guitar. 

242
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.500
And, in a way, some people would say that this record was one of the formative things...

243
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.500
...in the creation that we now think of as Pink Floyd.

244
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:43.000
You know the long extended solos, and the abstract ventures into space with the guitar

245
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.500
and it all comes from here.

246
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
'Take Me to The River' Al Green sung by David Byrne.

247
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:06.500
And, one of the revelations of the day, 'The Struggle' by Toots and the Maytals.

248
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Never heard it before, want to hear it again.

248.5
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:20.000
[music plays]

249
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
I'd never even heard of this track.
