1.5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
My name is Mala, and I'm from London.

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm known as a producer, an engineer, label owner, a promoter

3
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,000
in what people nowadays consider to be Dubstep.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
One of the reasons why I've been invited here today is because John Peel was one of the first

5
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,800
well, actually was the first person

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,800
to play my music, as well as my peers' music

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
on what we consider to be mainstream radio. 

8
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,500
So for us back in 2003/2004, even now, it's a huge deal

9
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:24,000
because we are coming from a very underground background with a very underground mentality.

10
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,000
And I still operate in that way today

11
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,500
You know I still cut dub plates as I did many many years ago.

12
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,000
And the reason I like to cut my music to the dubplate

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,500
and why I still manufacture vinyl when I sell my records is

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
because I think it is the optimum way that my music should be heard. 

15
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:02,000
I've managed to pick a good handful of records from what seems to be an impossible task.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That whole soundsystem culture that we learnt form you know

17
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,800
the Jungle pioneers, they obviously took from what they were growing up listening too. 

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,800
And a lot of that soundsystem culture was your Jah Shaka

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
was Aba Shanti-I.

20
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
It was UK soundsystem and Jamaican soundsystem culture. 

21
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,000
So, I got a few sevens. 

22
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,800
Honestly the amount of time I had was nowhere near enough to even scratch the surface

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
to be honest with you. 

24
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,000
Personally, for me and Augustus Pablo, I'll just take this whole section and dump it in the box.

25
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,700
For me, what I loved about Augustus Pablo

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
is there was a real freedom in the music when he plays

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and not that I try to recreate his sound or style of music

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
just hearing that freedom when I started creating music

29
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,000
really encouraged me to not worry about any rules.

30
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
I'll better just pick a couple I guess.  

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This particular song 'East of the River Nile', is one of the first songs I played to my son

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
after he was born, I think it was about nine days after he was born. 

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When you first have your first child

34
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,000
and your child cries longer than like three minutes straight

35
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
you think whats going on, is there a problem?

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,500
And I remember he wouldn't stop crying.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And I remember putting on some Augustus Pablo for him and it really just

38
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
you know straight away easing up.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is a very special record to me.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
And I know to my family as well.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,500
A really great record and a very strong and profound intro speech that is given.

41.1
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,500
'When we trod this line we walk for one reason'

41.2
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,000
'The reason is to try to help another man to think for himself'

41.3
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
'The music of our heart is roots music'

41.4
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
'Music which recalls history'

41.5
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,000
'Because without the knowledge of history you cannot determine your destiny'

41.6
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
'The music about the present'

41.7
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,000
'Because if you're not conscious of the present

41.8
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
you're like a cabbage in this society'

41.9
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,000
'Music which tells about the future

41.93
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
and the judgement which is to come'

4.96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
'The music of our art is roots presenting Misty in Roots'

4.99
00:04:43,500 --> 00:05:08,000
[music plays]

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,500
(John Peel) We usually play two or three reggae records in every programme

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
but I'd like to play more really.

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Cause I really like it a lot

45
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,000
and it's what I play when I'm stuck in here answering letters feeling sorry for myself. 

46
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Now if you ask me what it is I like about this album by Misty, I honestly couldn't tell you.

47
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,000
I think it's actually very spiritual music, and you can dance to it

48
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
well, I could if it wasn't for the war wounds

49
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,500
but y'know, I don't like to talk about them too much.

50
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,500
I can't remember how much I paid for my copy of this record.

51
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Such a good album, It's definitely one of my all time favourite albums. 

52
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,500
Listened to it so many times over the years.

53
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:07,000
Maybe this kind of somehow ties in with this, going into another period of time for me. 

54
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,000
This is The Ragga Twins y'know

55
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:17,000
I think The Ragga Twins deserve much respect and credit for their contribution to Jungle music. 

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It was these guys that were bringing their vibe and their sound and energy to those breakbeats

57
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,000
that in my opinion started shaping and forming that whole genre

58
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,300
and that whole style of the MC on the beat.

59
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Jungle music for me was the central point, cause from Jungle music

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
you could find elements of rare groove, elements of hip hop, elements of Dub, Reggae and Roots

61
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
of Techno, and of Hardcore. 

62
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
For me personally like 93/94, for me those two years

63
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't think there's any other music made like that, ever. 

64
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I guess from an outsiders point of view it was that transition from it being like

65
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:31,500
that hardcore thing, where I guess it was more unified as an underground movement.

66
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I dont know because I wasn't part of that movement, just from my outside perspective

67
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
and being a kid as well.

68
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But then, you know, 93/94 you started getting this separation

69
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,000
Hardcore was going one way, and Jungle was going another way

70
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,000
and me and my people, we were just straight up Junglists. 
 
71
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:04,000
Classic track, Maxi, Tom and Jerry, incredible record for those that know.

72
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
For those that don't know, you'll know after this for sure. 

73
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
At school, we used to record the radio sessions at the weekend

74
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,000
from like Kool FM or Energy FM or Dream FM. 

75
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Also you'd have people that would go to the record shops and buy the tape packs

76
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,000
like A.W.O.L. tape packs and stuff. 

77
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
What you'd do, you'd go to school on Monday

78
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and you'd trade them for sandwiches and that.

79
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
There was one guy whose mum just made the best sandwiches

80
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
so he was the guy that had the best tapes.

81
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,000
Awh man, this tune here. 

82
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This tune here man, this is one of my favourites. 

83
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:02,000
Hardleaders - Souljah, Fade 2 Black, haven't heard this for a long time. 

84
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:10,000
I once was at Metalheadz, and I heard Peshay do a mix of this and a track called Acid Track.

85
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,000
Metalheadz was, I guess a movement really

86
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,000
it was more than just a label, it was more than just a dance y'know

87
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
it was a whole sound, it was a whole mentality, a whole approach.

88
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It was set up by Goldie, and we used to go to Metalheadz from like 96 onwards. 

89
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We'd be the first in the queue, last one out

90
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
when they were pulling the plug, that's when we would leave. 

91
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But we absolutely loved the whole Metalheadz vibration. 

92
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:48,000
As I was saying, Peshay was playing there one time, played this tune man.

93
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,500
Aw man, the mix was so cold.

94
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,500
It was so cold that he reloaded both the tunes at the same time

95
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,500
and he did the mix again.

96
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll never forget that moment, incredible. 

97
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,000
This is a very big record for me. 

98
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Have to big up, you know Roots Manuva. 

99
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
Massively inspirational, you know

100
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,000
growing up listening to his music, especially knowing he was from Brixton. 

101
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,000
You know, ten minutes down the road from where we at. 

102
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,500
I remember seeing Roots Manuva play at Brixton Academy, many many years ago. 

103
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And you know, when he played Witness

104
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,000
and seeing everybody in Brixton Academy kinda fists up, you know what I mean. 

105
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,000
It was a real powerful moment man, especially for like a local bredda you know. 

106
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:49,500
People want music maybe for more entertainment purposes, maybe mainstream, it kind of like leans towards that. 

107
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Whereas something like this, it isn't necessarily gonna be played on mainstream radio

108
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,500
unless someone like John Peel would have played it

109
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
because he's not really coming with the entertainment, he's coming with the real talk.

110
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Being educated in Jungle and Drum and Bass

111
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
all those guys used to cut dubplates.

112
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,000
All those guys had exclusive tunes that only they had you know what I mean.

113
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
How I went about developing my sound wasn't conscious in the sense

114
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,000
oh there’s a gap in the market, let's try and fill it with this. 

115
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Its like everything was accelerating, so everything was getting faster. 

116
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Everything was about big build ups and big drops you know. 

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And for me it was like, when I was going home after a days work, and making music

118
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,000
it really was like a kind of meditation

119
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
and I guess thats where that kind of ‘meditate on bass weight’ comes into it

120
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,500
because we never thought we was making dance music, so to speak.

121
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So, we've got some Digital Mystikz stuff in here. 

122
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh right, this is our first record that we released

123
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,000
me and Coki on Big Apple records. 

124
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,500
I wouldn't usually select one of my own records to go in a box

125
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I find that quite a strange thing to do but because it's not just me

126
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,000
there's also Coki on there

127
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm putting this record in the box, to big up my brother Coki. 

128
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,000
I think we made these tracks in 2003

129
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,000
and the record shop closed down quite shortly after that. 

130
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,000
And that's the reason why we set up our own record label

131
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
because you know we just had done the record

132
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
but we had, you know an entire back catalogue on our harddrives of music

133
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,500
we'd been making already for a couple of years.

134
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
This is really interesting to find in there

135
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,500
because it's the first DMZ record, DMZ001.

136
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,500
And it features my press release, which isn't a press release

137
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
‘cause I never used to do press releases, I couldn't stand them. 

138
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:10,000
It just has an email here that I sent, and it's on the 2nd April 2004 at one in the morning. 

139
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,000
It says Easy Hermeet, who was producer assistant to John

140
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,000
It was real good to link you last night

141
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I thought fwd>> was banging too

142
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Fwd>> was a place that still goes on now which has dance

143
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It used to be at Plastic People in Shoreditch on Curtain Road. 

144
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,000
Fwd>> was just like the hub for all of us man.

145
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That was the place where tunes would get made there and tunes would break there too you know. 

146
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,000
Before we started DMZ.

147
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:51,000
It was forward thinking music, that's how it was perceived. It didn't have a ‘genre title’ as such.

148
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,000
People just went there and you knew that you weren't gonna hear that music

149
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
anywhere else in the world.

150
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,500
Because only that guy had it you know. 

151
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We used to cut dubplates especially for Hatcha

152
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,000
until we started playing ourselves.

153
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,000
Unfortunately I had to say to Hatch, 'I gotta keep some of the dubs for myself'.

154
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,000
All I know is I think I got a random message saying:

155
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,000
John really loves your music and he's been playing it on the show

156
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,000
and anything you wanna send us, please do.

157
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
So I just started sending music.

158
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,800
And also, I think still to this day, John Peel was the only person to 

159
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
play one of our records that was unreleased on mainstream radio.

160
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,000
So I used to send him kind of exclusive dubplates, and they got played. 

161
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,500
When I sent some of my records to him, I'd lost my job and I was looking for work

162
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and he must have mentioned it on the radio like:

163
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,000
'Good luck Mala looking for your new job you know'.

164
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,500
So it was that kind of like little personal things that he would push out there to people

165
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
kind of directly and maybe indirectly. 

166
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,000
Which I think is a really special thing when you have millions of people

167
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,500
but you make those millions feel like you're actually just talking to them one. 

168
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,500
I'll put this one in

169
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
you know I've gotta put Skream and Benga track again.

170
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,000
a very big record you know for the movement at the time.

171
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:28,000
Just in general like, I think what a lot of people used to hear about what we were doing back then

172
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,500
it really was a community of producers and artists that were likeminded 

173
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
that genuinely wanted to see each other move forward and make great music. 

174
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So when you hear a record like this

175
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:47,000
you'd just go home and you'd just be inspired to just make music and see how far you can take it. 

176
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,500
For us, it's not necessarily like oh we're doing something new, I never really felt that.

177
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
For me it was just, this is just a continuation of what it is that I love

178
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,000
and that's my interpretation of it. 

179
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,000
Nobody had any fear to be who they wanted to be and express that to the fullest. 

180
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And if there's anything that we have in life, it is a freedom of expression. 

181
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,000
If I'm gonna compromise that - you must be joking.

182
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,000
Because as I say, it's one of the only freedoms that I feel we truly have. 

183
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,000
So yeah.
