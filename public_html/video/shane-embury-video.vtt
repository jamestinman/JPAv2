1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm Shane Embury, bass player for Napalm Death.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Been in the band for 27 years.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I guess we're attributed with being one of the first bands to form the genre Grindcore

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and I'm here at John Peel's house to look through his millions of records

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and put a box together

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of records that influenced me 

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
from my earlier years and 

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
show what different forms of music influenced Napalm.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Amazing feeling to be here

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and look through the records.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I could be here for a very long time.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Going back to probably an age of about 6 or 7,

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I was born in a small village,

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'd get 7 inches bought for me by my mum

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
from a local record shop that was also a bicycle shop. 

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I was really into a band called Slade from Birmingham.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It took me about 10 years to find it but I got it.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Great album, great cover, great haircuts, everything. Brilliant!

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It was just heavy drums, it's everything I was into. 

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was a budding drummer from a young age. 

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I used to get my grandma's buckets out on a weekly basis

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and bash the hell out of them every week and put holes in them.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Slade were wild and nutty so right up my street really,

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I loved that stuff.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
Slade were very popular at that point,

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,500
so were the Sweet, and Top of the Pops was always on.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,500
And of course the theme tune to Top of the Pops

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
was originally the Zeppelin track

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,500
so I think all those elements inspired my love of distorted guitar. 

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
Back then, compared to nowadays, 

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
it wasn't that distorted but it was still over the top for me.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I just loved the sound of it.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm pretty thankful my mum bought me this

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,500
and not a Rupert the Bear 7 inch really, 

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
it would have been strange to see where it went after that.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And alongside Slade really, the band called Sweet,

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
which is the first 7" I got by them

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
it's a Blockbuster 7 inch. 

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,500
I preferred the B-side, as I mentioned,

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
much heavier, and the riffing is very influencial,

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
definitely paved the way as bands went on.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So we'll see if the B-side is actually better than the A-side,

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
many years later.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So there you go, straight away!

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I mean listen to that.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's just like...

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There you go.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's still totally amazing after all these years.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Listen to that, what's that year?

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
'73 or something? '74?

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That picking style, just evolved over the years....

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Judas Priest...and just kept getting faster and faster

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
until you get to Metallica, and the thrash picking.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sure it all just came from the early '70s and just got faster and faster.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You put that on and say 'Bloody hell, how heavy is that?'

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,500
Chuffed to bits with that kind of guitar sound.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Even then. Actually I've heard some bands with far worse guitar sounds than that!

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,500
I wanted to be in a band as soon I heard these bands,

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500
bashing my drums and stuff. It was great.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And that's kind of like, the first two bands for me which took me onto Judas Priest.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is a great record.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I think this was called 'Hell Bent For Leather' in the States,

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
paranoid Americans probably worried about the title 'Killing Machine'.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,500
When I was growing up in a small village

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,500
there wasn't much to do so I was quite an escapist,

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,500
definitely outcast in the village.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,500
The rest of the people from school

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,500
thought I was a bit strange for listening to heavy metal.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,500
This was the second one I had from the Brittania Music Club,

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
£1.49 I believe. Brilliant. Heavy stuff.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Rob Halford still had some hair there.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Not sure about Glenn Tipman's pose on that one...

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,500
It's funny because all the bands that looked odd

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,500
or quite abrasive and strange and my mum would always go

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
"Look at the state of that" and whatever,

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
and then there was Exploited and she was like

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,500
"Look at the state of him"

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and I was like "What's wrong with it? Looks killer!"

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,500
So this was on Top of the Pops,

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,500
the first track I heard by them,

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,500
and I was totally gobsmacked, was just sitting there,

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,500
fast, loud, heavy distorted guitar, obnoixous, brilliant.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,500
Loved it!

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,500
I thought "I'm into this"

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,500
I think it's one of the first points I could feel myself crossing

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
thinking "There must be more bands like this, I've got to find them out"

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,500
This is one of the bands that started to get me into hardcore punk,

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
them and Discharge

89
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,500
It's a strange thing really, when you think at school,

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,500
I rushed in the next day like 

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,500
"Did you see that band The Exploited on Top of the Pops last night - it was fucking brilliant!"

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,500
and everybody was like "Gah! Bollocks! Duran Duran!"

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,500
I'm like "Fuck that rubbish! Exploited, 

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,500
this is what I'm into, this is the way forward, you know".

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,500
And here's the first 7 inch along with Nazi Punks Fuck Off,

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,500
and the voice struck me as being really interesting

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,500
because a lot of punk bands were very aggressive vocally,

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
while the Dead Kennedys were very high pitched.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,500
I love the sound of it, the B-side, as I mentioned as 

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,500
I was always into the B-sides as well,

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,500
moreso than the A-sides, they always seemed more interesting.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This seems really...at the time...just haunting.

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And those kind of progressions, guitar-wise,

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
those are the kind of progressions I would like, they sound irregular.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,500
And monotonous as well.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There's almost got a kind of Black Sabbath bassline.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's not quite as sinister as I remember...

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,500
And that brings us, more importantly, to Crass.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,500
Crass 7 inch, which is one of many that are out there that I picked,

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
but these are very important for 1981-85 period Napalm Death.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Nicholas Bowen who was the main guy that formed Napalm Death in 1981,

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Crass was one of the main bands that he was into.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Crass were instrumental in their thought process, musically,

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and also ideology-wise, and also with Napalm Death to this day

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
the ideology - the themes Crass talk about are still prevalent today

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
for sure, their influence still resonates within the band.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:00:27,000
As if by magic...

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,500
Discharge. Gobsmacked.

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,500
They must have captured the moment in a way - really powerful.

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,500
For me - one of the top ten punk records,

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
everything about it is so intense.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,500
The best way to describe it is an ultra punishing sound,

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,500
this is where metal and punk were crossing over.

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,500
These guys created a whole drum beat that was unique.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's like [demonstrates] - that's the snares.

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That beat has been used by millions and millions of punk bands

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
that's the D beat - the Discharge beat - and these guys created it.

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,500
My friends were kind of satisfied with AC/DC or Judas Priest,

129
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,500
and they were like "that's enough".

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,500
When I heard bands like Venom or these or Discharge

131
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,500
I got a kick out of it, like a childish kick - 

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
"I can't believe they've done this".

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,500
The Shades was a record store in London at the time many years ago,

134
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,500
and you would see their adverts in the metal mags

135
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,500
that would say 'this is the fastest thing yet'.

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,500
You had no idea if it was any good,

137
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,500
but I just had to see those words and I was like

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,500
'I'm ordering that album'.

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,500
Sometimes it wasn't the fastest and it wasn't that good

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
- or the first track was fast and the rest weren't so I was disappointed.

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,500
But it was just something that I was into

142
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,500
and a couple of my friends were the same.

143
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But Metallica was definitely one of those bands that came out

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,500
their original demo was very popular in the tape trading scene

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,500
which I was going to later become involved in.

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It was because of the tape trading scene - the underground as they called it -

147
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
loving it so much that got them their record deal.

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,500
Groundbreaking album really.

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Micky from Napalm - some of the guys that I met when I went to see gigs at the Mermaid -

150
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,500
it was one of the bands that had crossed over to their side.

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,500
As I was crossing over to the punk scene, or had been,

152
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,500
they were getting into the metal bands,

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,500
into Metallica and Slayer, Celtic Frost and Venom.

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,500
Because to them it sounds more punk

155
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,500
and they were going over like this

156
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and the punk bands were sounding like the harder edge of thrash metal

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and vice versa.

158
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,500
And at the same time Micky the drummer from Napalm introduced me to these guys

159
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,500
Swans.

160
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,500
They're the other end of the spectrum because they're really slow.

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Painfully slow - that was their thing.

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,500
They weren't really everybody's cup of tea but I loved them.

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,500
I really loved the sound that they made, the monotony.

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,500
They became really important in Napalm's evolution.

165
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,500
Grindcore to us, as much as were into fast hard grinding music,

166
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Swans were just as grinding to us but at the other end of the spectrum.

167
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
These guys played the Mermaid in Birmingham in '85...'86...'87, can't remember

168
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,500
which was the place Napalm Death played,

169
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,500
Heresy, Sacrilege, Antisect, Extreme Noise Terror...all the old punk bands...

170
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,500
and they played so loud they pretty much ripped the plaster off the wall.

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,500
No word of a lie.

172
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,500
It was an old building anyway, but the whole building resonated, 

173
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
plaster falling off the walls.

174
00:12:33,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The Mermaid was an amazing place in '85...'86...'87...'88...

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,500
loads of great gigs.

176
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,500
For a few years, just pivotal to the punk hardcore scene.

177
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,500
So many bands played there - Extreme Noise Terror,

178
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,500
Heresy, Electro Hippies, Amoebics, Sacrilege, Antisect,

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,500
a couple of bands from America came over - DRI, Government Issue,

180
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,500
stuff like that.

181
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,500
It was just brilliant, the first gig I went to

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,500
I was invited to see was Napalm, Heresy,

183
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,500
Amoebics...it was £1.50 to get in,

184
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,500
loads of punks sprawled all over the floor, pints of scrumpy for 50p.

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13:500
It was a really friendly atmosphere, people were great.

186
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,500
We walked in, we were a little bit nervous at the time, we were quite young,

187
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,500
my friend Mitch recognised Justin,

188
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,500
the guitarist at the time because Justin had invited him over,

189
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,500
so we talked to Justin and then Micky Harris saw my denim jacket

190
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,500
with all the crazy band names written on it that he'd never heard of 

191
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,500
he was intrigued by that

192
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,500
and probably the way I looked at the time knowing Micky

193
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,500
and came stumbling over and we became friends instantly,

194
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,500
straight away and I watched Napalm live and I was like 

195
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,500
"Jesus, this is amazing".

196
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,500
I followed the Napalm Death guys around

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,500
and stayed at Micky's house for a long weekend

198
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and the Mermaid was our thing really. 

199
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,500
This is an important band to me

200
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,500
Slab - influenced by Swans.

201
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,500
This is an amazing record.

202
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,500
Prior to this record they had various versions that were almost...

203
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,500
disco funk or something really.

204
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,500
I guess they re-recorded some of their earlier songs

205
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,500
but they did it in such an intense way... they were using samples.

206
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,500
In Tunnel of Love, the first song,

207
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,500
I'm pretty sure they must have sampled a concrete mixer,

208
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,500
it was this insane noise that came in with this heavy drum beat.

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I was like "listen to the sound of that".

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,500
So intense, just that record really.

211
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,500
The track Fleur, the bass sound,

212
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,500
that's probably still one of the grindiest bass tones you'll hear

213
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That was the blueprint for my bass tone.

214
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,500
Here you go really...Grindcore.

215
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,500
Napalm Death are credited with being the originators,

216
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
but really two bands that are massively important,

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,500
Repulsion - you wouldn't have Grindcore without these guys.

218
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,500
And in conjunction at the same time - Terrorizer.

219
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,500
Two bands across the seas - I became good friends with both -

220
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,500
Jesse joined Napalm on guitar later on.

221
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,500
Very important bands really.

222
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,500
You can definitely tell Repulsion influenced Terrorizer,

223
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,500
and likewise both bands influenced Napalm later on.

224
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,500
And likewise we influenced them.

225
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,500
Definitely two of the most important records in the foundation of Grindcore.

226
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,500
I will go out on a limb and say I used to put this on in the bedroom

227
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,500
when you're a young lad, and practice the old headbanging to this.

228
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,500
I was not ashamed to say this it was amazing.

229
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,500
This was it for me until I saw Napalm Death.

230
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I used to tape trade with these two - Oscar and Jessie

231
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,500
and I wasn't familiar with the LA timezone so I'd ring these guys at 2 in the morning.

232
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,500
They were both Mexican and their mum didn't like me very much

233
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
so I'd get this loud Spanish telling off for waking them up.

234
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,500
What we have here, finally is The Peel Session - test pressing.

235
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,500
Which is always nice.

236
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,500
Lots of stars here - next to the tracks -

237
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,500
I believe was John's rating of whether it was good or not.

238
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,500
I presume a lot of stars mean it's good.

239
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,500
Goes up to three - but I see here that there's a four.

240
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,500
So that must...oh there's a few fours...

241
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,500
So he really liked this.

242
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,500
And here's the actual thing itself...

243
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It was a great experience really.

244
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
They were used to the bands recording four songs

245
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,500
but we recorded 16 in 5 3/4 minutes.

246
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So that kinda put them in a bit of a flummox I guess.

247
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,500
I was a big thumbs up really, we were really chuffed and happy.

248
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,500
And now I'm sitting here.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,500
So all those teachers that told me I was going to get nowhere

250
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,500
can fuck off really.

251
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
[laughs]
