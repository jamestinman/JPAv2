00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,000
Hi, my name's Don Letts.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,000
I make films, I DJ, I have a show on BBC Six Music.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And I'm here today to look through the window into John Peel's world,

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,000
and unlock one of the many stories suggested by his amazing record collection.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Today's chapter is: A Punky Reggae Party.

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,000
{MUSIC PLAYS}

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
"Leader of the human race,

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,000
don't judge me by the colour of my face,

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
whether I'm black or white,

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
let's all unite".

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, I've had the great pleasure of rummaging through John Peel's record collection.

12
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
With a view to telling the story of A Punky Reggae Party,

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and kind of my story as well.

14
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
And it's been a trip. It's kind of overwhelming.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I mean it's obviously vinyl heaven.

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,000
And I pulled this out: King Stitt 'Herbsman's Shuffle'.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ah, here's a Reggae classic, a favourite of my Dad's,

18
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,000
and Joe Strummer's actually.

19
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,000
You know it's funny, my Dad used to have a soundsystem,

20
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
and it used to be called 'Duke Letts Superstonic Sound'.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not like a soundsystem that you have nowadays, with one red lightbulb

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
and people with a bag of weed.

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,000
It was more astere, and they'd be more likely to be carrying bibles.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Cause they were like these collective affairs that people would go too after Sunday church.

25
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,000
Y'know where they'd kind of share their experiences and ease the pain of grafting all week.

26
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,300
And playing records too each other was a way of staying...

27
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,500
...not only in touch with each other, but staying in touch with what was going on back home.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And back home, they were listening to sounds like this from King Stitt. 

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's have a listen.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Man this is gonna take me back.

31
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,000
"No matter what the people say,

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
these sounds lead the way,

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's daughter of the day, from boss DJ,

34
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,000
I King Stitt, shout it from the top

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,000
to the very last drop".

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,000
I remember every word, damn.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
{MUSIC PLAYS}

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,500
Right.

39
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,000
Got a bit of soul,

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
got a bit of rock, bit of reggae:

41
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,000
beginnings of Don Letts.

42
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
I grew up listening to both black and white music, 

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and my taste kind of reflects the duality of my existence. 

44
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,000
So at home I'm listening to stuff like early Toots, 

45
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,000
and early U-Roy and I-Roy.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But at the same time I'm listening to the alternative music,

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
such as it was then,

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
through stations like Radio Luxembourg.

49
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm listening to things like The Stones, The Who, The Faces, The Yarbirds.

50
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,000
And other records like, I pulled this out actually as well.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A bit of an odd one, this is a group called The Idle Race.

52
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,000
Probably wouldn't have heard of them, but thats what was interesting about Luxembourg,

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,000
It wasn't just playing The Beatles and The Stones and all that stuff,

54
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,000
It was also playing odd things like this.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Y'know I guess my musical taste was kind of dictated by the fact that not only was I listening to Jamaican music,

56
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
but I was listening to popular white music at the time.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And that was really kind of compounded by going to school in South London... 

58
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,000
...called Archbishop Tennisons, Grammar school, it was smart.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
By that time I was listening to a lot of things that my white mates were listening too.

60
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,200
One particular thing I remember is that one day we were in the playground, 

61
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,000
and this rumour starts going round the school that some band are gonna be playing at a place called the Young Vic in South London.

62
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,000
No one knew who the band was, but nevertheless, after school, we all went in our school uniforms.

63
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,000
Turns out it's The Who, doing a full production rehearsal. 

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That means y'know, it wasn't like rehearsing, they're doing a full on show,

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
in front of a cast of thousands.

66
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
There's the lazers and the lights and everything.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And I was 15 feet away from the band, including Keith Moon.

68
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,000
And I'll tell you, after that, my whole life changed, fucked me up totally.

69
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,000
From that day on I became a rebel, 'Who's Next', a great British record.

70
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:06,000
So I'm getting Led Zeppelin, and Cream, and Nice and Captain Beefheart at school,

71
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,000
and stuff coming in from America, stuff like this:

72
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,000
James Brown, 'Say it Loud: I'm Black and I'm Proud'.

73
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,800
A tremendously empowering record for me because,

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
you've got to understand, I say Black and British, it kind of rolls off the tounge now.

75
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Back then it was a very confusing concept, it was like a weird social experiment.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And it was about the same time that Enoch Powell had made his 'Rivers of Blood' speech.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Racism and all this situation got very polarised.

78
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,000
When I played this I was empowered, I was tooled up.

79
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,000
Before Punk Rock, people forget that what a lot of white kids and black kids were listening to up and down the country,

80
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,000
before Punk exploded, was Soul which a lot people think was all smooth and groovy dancefloor stuff,

81
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,000
but there was also people like Funkadelic, who I'm trying to find at the moment.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They were somewhere else man. It was mindblowing.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Hold up...mindblowing, how appropriate.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
'Free Your Mind and Your Arse Will Follow'. This record is incredible.

85
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
When me and the brothers heard this, it floored us.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Because everyone else was doing the sort of the Motown, the suits, the slicked hair, the fancy dance moves.

87
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,000
These guys were taking acid, they were totally fucked up.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And it was politicised as well, it wasn't like they were just jamming and being crazy.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is definitely going in my box.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
By the mid Seventies, you had massive unemployment, there were three day weeks,

92
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,000
there was a lot of strikes, rubbish piled up everywhere because the bin men weren't collecting the rubbish. 

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And again, the rise of the National Front, which was always looming in the background.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,500
And I'd left school, and got myself a job in this place called Acme Attractions on Kings Road, Chelsea.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It was all kind of retro clothing, mohair jumpers, jelly shoes, peg leg trousers,

96
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:07,500
and jukeboxes. And in that shop, my soundtrack was Hardcore Dub Reggae.

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,500
I was playing what I like, which again by this point had become very militant and politicised,

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,500
again informed by what was going on in america, with the whole Civil Rights thing.

99
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:26,000
Ah, Johnny Rotten's favourite record: Doctor Alimantado's 'Born for a Purpose'. 

100
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:37,000
{MUSIC PLAYS}

101
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,000
Before the advent of Bob Marley, Rasta's were kind of frowned upon in Jamaica.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And this is a true story of Doctor Alimantado being purposefully run over by a bus driver.

103
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,000
But he survived, hence the title 'Born for a Purpose'.

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Classic lyrics: 'If you feel like you have no reason for living, don't determine my life'.

105
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,000
And that's what it was about, writing our own soundtrack.

106
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,000
And like I said, I had mine, with the Reggae thing, but my white mates didn't have a soundtrack,

107
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,000
so they were looking for something that felt relevant to their own situation.

108
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,000
And a lot of that, funnily enough, would initially come from America.

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,500
The Ramones. This is the record that Sid Vicious stayed up all night listening too.

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And in the morning, he could play bass. Kind of.

111
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,000
Such a different sound to the popular music of the time.

112
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,000
The ELO's and The Eagle's and all the rest of it.

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can see why this captured the imagination of my white mates.

114
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,000
So, Acme Attractions is bubbling, the Punk Rock scene is starting to come together,

115
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,000
starting to gain a bit of press and a bit of notority

116
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,000
spearheaded of course, by the formation of The Pistols.

117
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,000
There's a vibe building, with band's starting to form, but they've got nowhere to play.

118
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,000
So the accountant for Acme Attractions, a guy called Andrew Czezowski

119
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,000
decided to create the first dedicated live Punk Rock venue.

120
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,000
It was called The Roxy, in Covent Garden, which used to be an old gay club.

121
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,000
And because of the reaction that he saw to the records that I was playing in the shop

122
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,000
he asked me to have a go at djing,

123
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,000
I'd never Dj'd in my bloody life, but I thought I'd have a go.

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Now, this is all so new in the Punk Rock scene, that there weren't any Punk records to play.

126
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,000
What's Don Letts gonna do? I continued playing my Hardcore Dub Reggae records and lucky for me,

127
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
the Punks loved it.

128
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,000
Augustus Pablo's 'King Tubby Meets the Rockers Uptown'.

129
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,000
King Tubby, along with Lee Perry, really pioneered the whole advent of dub music. 

130
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,000
Which was really born of studio technique.

131
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:53,800
You know their talent was to push the bass centre stage, and use the mixing desk as an instrument in itself.

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,500
And echo, echo comes in big time.

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think that attracted people because it left room in the mix for you to put yourself in the music.

134
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,000
It kind of soundtracked whatever thoughts were going on inside your head.

135
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
And the Punks really picked up on that. 

136
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,000
So I'm playing all these kind of Dub Reggae records.

137
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,000
And it found a natural home with the Punks,

138
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,000
because like I say, there was a history of white people listening to Jamaican music,

139
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
that predated the punk movement.

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,500
Y'know truth be told, before Don Letts and the Punky Reggae Party

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,500
there was a whole movement of the Skinheads, that were like the fashion version not the facist version

142
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
that were listening to the Trojan catalogue.

143
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,000
And they were hip to Jamaican music

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
There's a lot made of me starting The Punky Reggae party, but the truth of the matter is

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,300
white working class people were already listening to Jamaican music.

146
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,500
I think the people that I turned onto Reggae, were the people that didn't grow up living next to black people. 

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Back in the mid seventies, that was a lot of people. 

148
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,500
So there I am ensconced in the rock scene, playing these records inbetween these fast and furious live sets.

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The Clash opened it on January the 1st 1977,

150
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,000
but after them, everybody who was anybody, besides The Pistols in the Punk scene played there.

151
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,000
Regulars were The Damned, who famously had the first punk record, 'New Road'.

152
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,000
Great record, I've never been a great Damned fan, but I'll tell you what,

153
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,000
they rocked the crowd.

154
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:23,000
And there were The Jam, we had The Slits, The Buzzcocks, Subway Set, Siouxsie and the Banshees,

155
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,000
lunatics like Johnny Moped, and the list goes on.

156
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,500
I mean like I said, everybody who was anybody played at the Roxy.

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,500
So, Punk Rockers have got a place to play,

158
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and now they've got a band championing their sound, because in this cultural climate the Sex Pistols are formed.

159
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
On the back of the The Sex Pistols, you had The Clash.

160
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,200
The Pistols burst on the scene and it was like a carrying call, a call to arms.

161
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,000
A cultural ground zero.

162
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,300
All of a sudden my white mates now had a soundtrack that was...

163
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:02,500
...of the people, for the people, by the people, and that was about things that were affecting them on a day to day basis. 

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This group and this record, is what kickstarted the whole Punk Rock thing in the UK.

165
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
A test pressing of 'Anarchy in The UK'.

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The record that kickstarted the whole thing.

167
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:39,000
{MUSIC PLAYS}

168
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You know, what's funny about this shit is everybody said The Pistols couldn't play,

169
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,300
but that there it's all in place, everything's happening, 

170
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
the bass, the guitar, the drums, John's vocals,

171
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I mean what the hell, that was a rocking record man.

172
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,000
The interesting thing about The Roxy is it's become this legendary mythological thing, you know it was only open three months.

173
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Literally, January the 1st 1977 to whatever was three months was later.

174
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,500
And it's interesting because after the club finished at night, every night in fact.

175
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Many of the major players in the Punk Rock scene, would get in my car and a few other cars

176
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,500
and drive to my place in Forest Hill where I lived with all my Rasta bredrin.

177
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The party would continue through the night.

178
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,700
What I came to realise is that, not only were they interested in listening to my Reggae collection, 

179
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,300
but by this time I'm starting to do the Punk Rock thing with the super eight camera

180
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,000
and I'm projecting the images on the wall in my living room.

181
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,000
Of course I realised what they were really doing was checking out how they were coming across,

182
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
they were checking out their presence, their image.

183
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,500
And with a view to really thinking about where they were going,

184
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
because you know they didn't wanna be just screaming kids that were stamping their feet.

185
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,000
That was just a starting point, you know they had aspirations;

186
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
to kind of be able to play their instruments,

187
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,000
and to be part of this kind of lineage of rock and roll man.

188
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
They wanted to bring something to the table, and they wanted to pass on the energy that had inspired them.

189
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,000
And in fact, after The Pistols did that thing on the Bill Grundy show,

190
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,000
which basicially turned into a sort of fuck you session, sorry for the language.

191
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,000
That was broadcast nationally across the UK, and the next day everybody thought that's what Punk was about.

192
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And to my mind it created what I called a tabloid Punk, you know binliners and spiky hair.

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Literally the very next day, all the smarter and the more intellectual people dissociated themselves.

194
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
From that first incarnation of what they called Punk.

195
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And not long after that, to my mind the whole thing got a lot more interesting.

196
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And eventually became the Post-Punk scene.

197
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And The Slits to me, were sort of the beginning of the Post-Punk movement.

198
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,300
Where people kind of freed themselves up from the shackles of what Punk had become.

199
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,000
It's funny though, once give yourself a label, that's all you can be.

200
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Ah, The Slits, one of my favourite Punk Rock groups.

201
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:19,000
And they really continued the DIY ethic because people wanted to get flash producers and things like that,

202
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,000
and they didn't want any of that, they actually got in one of my friends called Dennis Bovell to produce this album.

203
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,500
And, they were one of the last Punk bands to be signed, they were so out there.

204
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I mean they terrified men, they terrified record companies.

205
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And this record, I think is a work of genius.

206
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,000
And a great inspiration to women up and down the country.

207
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Not only only The Slits on stage, they were The Slits offstage as well, it wasn't an act.

208
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,000
It was inherent of who they were.

209
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
It was very feminist without them saying it was feminist you know.

210
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They didn't a manifesto, it was just who they were.

211
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And musically, they'd gone way beyond the fast and furious guitars,

212
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,500
and they were bringing in Reggae, African rhythms, a bit of Avant Garde Jazz.

213
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh look, I've got a credit on the back of this, shit I forgot that.

214
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Ahh. They're dearly missed.

215
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,000
In '77 Bob Marley was living in the UK, just around the corner from my shop actually on Oakley Street.

216
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,000
He'd been shot actually, in Jamaica, and had kind of relocated to the UK.

217
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,000
And we became friends because of our mutual love of a particular plant,

218
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and one day I went round to his place, to collect some money he owed me.

219
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:47,000
And I'm wearing my bondage trousers, and Bob, he'd been reading the tabloid press too.

220
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And had picked up on all this negative aspect of what punk was about, or what he thought it was about.

221
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,000
And he saw me in my bondage trousers, and he's like Don Letts, 'What we dealing with?'

222
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,000
'You look like one of them nasty blud clart Punk Rockers'.

223
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,000
And I'm like 'Scuse me Bob, we're in English'

224
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
And he's like 'Don Letts, what you dealing with, you look like a nasty punk rocker.

225
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And I'm like 'Hold on a minute Bob, you've got it wrong, these are my friends you're talking about'.

226
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,000
And I basically had to stand my ground.

227
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,000
And I wasn't like, the big Don Letts you see now,

228
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,000
I was like a baby dread, but I had to stand my ground and defend my mates.

229
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,500
And basically I said 'Look Bob, you're wrong, these are likeminded rebels and there is something going on here'.

230
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,500
And he told me to bugger off, so I left with my tail between my legs.

231
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Three months later, after he'd become a lot more familiar with the scene,

232
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,000
he was moved to write this tune.

233
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,000
Which I found in Mr Peel's collection, a white label of Punky Reggae party.

234
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
I got the last laugh Bob.

235
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Respect.
