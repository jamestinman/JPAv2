                    <p>I share Paul Simon’s admiration for the late <span class="small">⑤</span> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Jeter" target="_blank">Rev. Claude Jeter</a> of the Swan Silvertones, the greatest falsetto singer ever recorded. Is it androgynous sexual bravado, an evocation of orgasm, or perhaps the shamanic imitation of an animal’s cry from a pre-historic hunters’ ceremony? Did the Pharaoh’s eunuchs sing in Ancient Egypt? Did castrati remind aristocratic Europeans of our Rift Valley origins? </p>

                    <p>None of these questions are answerable, but we can say that that no falsetto vocal has ever been more widely imitated than Mitch Margo’s on <span class="small">⑦</span> The Tokens’ recording of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight”. </p>

                    <p>In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight. That melody was a one-take, spur-of-the-moment improvisation during a 1938 recording of “Mbube”, a song about a Zulu boy braving lions in the Natal bush. The singer was Solomon Linda, leader of the Original Evening Birds, and he always sang fasi pathi – the falsetto part. Zulus, more than any other southern African nation, left families at home and worked on temporary contracts in the cities; women being such a key part of Zulu musical tradition, falsetto vocals compensated for the lack of female voices in the new urban life.</p>

                    
  
                    
                

                    <p>Solomon Linda had come to Johannesburg from the remote <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Msinga+Valley&safe=strict&es_sm=119" target="_blank">Msinga Valley</a>, where he grew up with <span class="small">⑨</span> traditional Zulu vocal harmony. Once in Jo’burg, he formed the Evening Birds to compete in the <span class="small">⑩</span> singing contests that were a staple entertainment for urban Zulus. Organizers would recruit a white man as judge (neutral through ignorance) and award a goat as first prize. Tall and a sharp-dresser, Linda added slick footwork and a second bass voice to make <span class="small">⑪</span> his group stand out. </p>

                    <div>
                        <img src="img/mbube-roots.jpg">
                        <div class="note"><i>Solomon Linda (Left) and his Evening Birds.</i></div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The rural Zulu economy is based on cattle; they love singing about herd-boys defying and occasionally ganging together to kill a lion. The Birds’ goat-winner, “Mbube”, was such a song.</p>

                    <p>Eric Gallo emigrated from Italy to South Africa and started a business importing hillbilly records. While whites may have had more money, they lacked Africans’ passion for music and Gallo soon built a recording studio and hired a ‘native’ talent scout. Former choirmaster Gilbert Motsieloa didn’t have far to look: Solomon Linda was packing 78s in the Gallo warehouse. </p>

            <div class="main wrapper clearfix">

                
                <div class="mainText">


                    <p>Motsieloa felt the <span class="small">⑫</span> first two takes of “Mbube” didn’t do it justice, so he invited in the banjo, guitar and piano players waiting for the next session to give it extra energy. On <span class="small">⑬</span> the master take you can hear Linda hesitate before starting his golden descant over those two basses riffing “uyimbubeh, uyimbubeh”. The recording was released in 1938 on the day Hitler invaded Poland. By 1948, it had sold over 100,000 copies and that style of Zulu harmony singing had become known as “mbube”.</p>

                    <br>   

                    <p>The Evening Birds were paid the normal pittance for the session and it never occurred to Gallo – or to Linda - to register the song or calculate composer royalties. The group became stars, but Linda kept his day-job in the shipping room; ‘singer’ was not a recognized employment category for the government pass he needed to avoid being sent back to Msinga. </p>

                    <p>Helped by “Mbube”, Gallo grew to dominate the South African record industry. After the war, they secured local rights to the American Decca label and, hoping for some reciprocal business, shipped samples of their best-selling titles to Decca’s New York office. The box languished in a corner until Alan Lomax, who was working on a field-recording project for the label, took it home to the apartment he shared with Pete Seeger. </p>

                    <p>Intrigued, Seeger brought “Mbube” to his group, the Weavers, and <span class="small">⑭</span> “Wimoweh” (Seeger’s misunderstanding of uyimbubeh) became their showstopper. It might have topped the Hit Parade as their follow-up to “Goodnight Irene”, but the House Un-American Activities Committee opened an <span class="small">⑮</span> investigation into the Weavers’ politics in 1951 just as “Wimoweh” reached #6. Nervous radio stations dropped it and the group went into a decade-long eclipse. </p>

                    <p>A few years later, the cover versions began: Yma Sumac, Jimmy Dorsey, the Kingston Trio….. In 1960 when the Margo brothers suggested it for their first recording session as The Tokens, the RCA producer insisted it needed an English lyric. Veteran songwriter George David Weiss (“Wonderful World”, “Can’t Help Falling In Love With You”) turned Linda’s one-line improvisation into the central melody and wrote verses the group hated. Initially a B-side, “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” started getting play in Massachusetts, spread rapidly down the East Coast, then soared like Mitch’s falsetto to #1.<span class="small">⑰</span> The LP cover featured a girl in a nightie with a huge cuddly lion.</p>

                    <p>Over the years, “Wimoweh”/”The Lion Sleeps Tonight” has become one of the most played, most covered, highest revenue-generating copyrights of all time, including serial visits to the Top Ten by falsetto-flaunting singers in America, Britain and France. (The stuffed lion re-appears in <span class="small">⑱</span> Tight Fit’s 1982 video.)</p>

                    <p> There were, of course, lawsuits. As an arranger of “traditional” material, Pete Seeger earned composer royalties on “Wimoweh” from the Weavers’ and other 1950s versions. Gallo challenged, theoretically on behalf of Linda, although they had no publishing contract with him. They ended up with a share of “Wimoweh” and though Seeger asked his publisher, Howie Richmond, to make sure Linda got a taste, nothing made it past a Johannesburg law office until long after the singer’s death.</p>

                    <p>Weiss’s publishers took the view that “Lion” was an entirely new song, a position Richmond and Gallo contested. After years of skirmishing everyone ended up with a piece except Solomon Linda. When Disney included it in the score of <span class="small">⑲</span> The Lion King, the sums involved became even more astronomical. Rian Malan, scion of a powerful Afrikaner family (whose uncle was behind the <a href="http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-03-01/news/9201110657_1_inkatha-paramilitary-training-african-national-congress" target="_blank">“arms to Inkatha”</a> scheme) wrote an account of the song’s complex history for Rolling Stone. This helped trigger a more equitable distribution of royalties and a sizeable payment to Linda’s niece, then living in poverty. The endless covers of “Lion” now include versions by Chet Atkins, REM and the New Zealand Army Band.</p>
